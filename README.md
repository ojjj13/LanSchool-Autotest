# LanSchool-Autotest
simple test prototype for lanschool teacher.exe

Later I found something more handier which is "sikuli" - a java based app using image detect instead of text-base detect.
But it can encounter some problem when deal with a high dpi device which windows can't render the resolution properly.

So pywinauto is not that easy to replace i guess? while pyatom on mac is very hard to use because the lack of documentation.
