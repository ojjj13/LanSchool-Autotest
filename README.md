# LanSchool-Autotest
simple test prototype for lanschool teacher.exe

Later I found something more handier which is "sikuli" - a java based app using image sniff instead of text-base sniff.
But it can encounter some problem when deal with a application have "fullscreen opreation" which you can't do anything at that moment.
